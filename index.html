      Functional Electrical Stimulation in Neurorehabilitation: A Systematic Review Using Synthory.AI
    </h1>
<h1 id="chapter_0">
      Abstract
    </h1>
<p>
      This systematic review evaluates the role of functional electrical stimulation (FES) in neurorehabilitation, focusing on spinal cord injuries and stroke. Utilizing the Synthory.AI service, the review adheres to PRISMA guidelines to synthesize research from 2015 onwards. Eleven studies were included, highlighting FES's potential to enhance motor function, muscle strength, and functional independence. Notable improvements were observed in Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Action Research Arm Test scores. Despite promising outcomes, limitations such as small sample sizes and methodological constraints were noted. Future research should address these issues, focusing on larger cohorts and standardized measures. This review underscores the transformative potential of FES while identifying areas for further exploration.

<p>
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has emerged as a promising intervention to enhance mobility and clinical management for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Advances in FES systems have demonstrated potential in improving motor control, mitigating muscle fatigue, and enabling controlled postural adjustments to support functional independence. Recent developments emphasize the integration of adaptive stimulation strategies and innovative biomechanical sensing technologies, bridging the gap between laboratory research and practical, patient-centered applications to optimize mobility outcomes for SCI patients.<br/><br/>Previous studies on functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) systems demonstrated significant advancements in enhancing standing neuroprosthesis functionality, including improved postural control, reduced muscle fatigue, and integration of sensory feedback for stability during manual tasks [<a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>]. Additionally, hybrid FES cycling showed promise in improving cardiovascular and metabolic health [<a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a>]. However, limitations such as impractical subject-specific controller tuning, restricted postural adaptability, and inconsistent bone health outcomes underscored the need for streamlined methodologies and improved sensor-based feedback systems [<a href="#ref20">20</a>]. These findings highlight the potential of FNS technologies while emphasizing the necessity of addressing technical challenges and optimizing protocols for broader clinical applicability.<br/><br/>The evaluation of trunk stabilization metrics provides insights into the functional capabilities of adaptive FES systems under dynamic conditions. The study quantified trunk stabilization performance under perturbation forces of up to 45% of body weight (Audu et al. <a href="#ref4">2015</a>), reporting mean settling times between 0.5 and 2.0 seconds and mean response times of approximately 400 milliseconds. These metrics demonstrate the system's ability to maintain consistent stabilization responses across varying conditions while accommodating subject-specific variations.<br/><br/>The controller's ability to respond to varying perturbation forces further highlights the potential for precise and adaptive stabilization in individuals with spinal cord injuries. The closed-loop controller effectively initiated stabilizing steps in response to forward-directed body perturbations in individuals with spinal cord injuries, achieving a mean reaction time of 125 ms (S.D. 18) (Hunt et al. <a href="#ref5">2017</a>). Perturbations above 10% BW were reliably detected, with larger perturbations (15% BW at 133 ms, 17.5% BW at 114 msp &lt0.005) triggering faster responses. These metrics reflect improved unloading and touchdown times, demonstrating the controller’s responsiveness to perturbation magnitude.<br/><br/>The observed improvements in joint moments and fatigue resistance underscore the benefits of closed-loop stimulation approaches in enhancing motor control and efficiency. Closed-loop SOPS stimulation demonstrated significant improvements in maintaining joint moments and reducing instability in participants with spinal cord injury, as evidenced by a prolonged time to fatigue (TF) below 0.135 Nm/kg and increased time below target (TBT) at 0.3 Nm/kg, as reported by Gelenitis et al. (<a href="#ref6">2020</a>). The approach also resulted in increased total work (W) and reduced ripple index (R) compared to open-loop SOPS, while achieving comparable R to constant stimulation. Additionally, closed-loop SOPS achieved higher cumulative charge (Q) in the latter half of trials and maintained a lower stimulation cost (C), reflecting enhanced efficiency and performance.<br/><br/>The integration of FES with motor assistance demonstrates advancements in achieving precise control and reducing physical strain during functional tasks. Kirsch et al. (<a href="#ref7">2018</a>) found that the hybrid neuroprosthesis demonstrated effective maintenance of a knee angle at 40°, achieving a 43.3% reduction in RMS error when integrating Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) with motor assistance compared to FES alone (p &lt0.05). This system also reduced muscle fatigue and motor torque requirements relative to motor-only conditions, indicating enhanced performance in scenarios requiring precise control and reduced physical strain. These findings on gait support and control align with broader efforts to optimize neuroprosthetic applications for improved mobility outcomes. Philipp Müller et al. (<a href="#ref8">2020</a>) found that the neuroprosthesis resulted in significant improvements in foot dorsiflexion (average increase of approximately 3 degrees) and plantarflexion (average increase of approximately 4 degrees), along with enhancements in RMS error during stimulation phases, indicating effective gait support and control.<br/><br/>The use of FES in weight-bearing exercises illustrates its role in promoting postural stability and sustained engagement in rehabilitation protocols. The study demonstrates that weight-bearing standing exercises with functional electrical stimulation (FES) significantly enhance biomechanical performance, as evidenced by a mean increase of 13.88 percentage points in supported body weight (p = 0.0071) and an improvement in body weight support on the stimulated leg from 63.69% to 78.61% (p = 0.0071) (Zoulias et al. <a href="#ref9">2019</a>). Additionally, participants maintained stable peak forces at or above 70% of body weight throughout the sessions, reflecting improved postural stability and sustained engagement in exercise protocols.<br/><br/>The findings contribute to the understanding of mobility and clinical management in spinal cord injury, focusing on the application of functional electrical stimulation and related technologies.

      The application of functional electrical stimulation (FES) for upper limb rehabilitation in post-stroke patients has demonstrated significant potential in restoring motor function, enhancing task performance, and promoting functional independence. Recent advancements in FES technologies, including closed-loop systems, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and electromyography (EMG)-based feedback, have further emphasized its role in neuromuscular reeducation and neuroplasticity. By leveraging these innovative control modalities, FES has shown measurable improvements in motor recovery, as evidenced by clinical scales, and continues to optimize post-stroke neurorehabilitation strategies. This chapter explores the latest research findings and advancements in FES-based interventions, highlighting their impact on stroke-related upper limb impairments.<br/><br/>Previous studies demonstrated that functional electrical stimulation (FES) significantly enhances upper limb function in stroke rehabilitation, with EMG- and BCI-controlled systems showing superior outcomes compared to non-FES approaches [<a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a>]. Hybrid systems integrating FES with robotics or virtual reality also showed potential for improved recovery [<a href="#ref34">34</a>]. However, limitations such as small sample sizes, lack of follow-up data, and insufficient validation of neuroplasticity outcomes restrict the generalizability and understanding of long-term effects. These findings underscore the need for robust randomized controlled trials and comprehensive assessments to establish standardized protocols and optimize clinical implementation.<br/><br/>These findings provide a foundation for understanding the impact of structured rehabilitation programs on motor function and activity levels in stroke recovery. Fujimoto et al. (<a href="#ref21">2024</a>) found that the task-oriented RFE program resulted in a statistically significant improvement in motor function, with a mean change in FMA scores of 14.6 (p=0.009), aligning with the previously observed effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions targeting upper limb recovery. Additionally, measures of activity, such as MAL-AOU and MAL-QOM, showed mean changes of 1.74 (p=0.014) and 1.72 (p=0.004), respectively, further supporting enhancements in functional movement and quality of use. These findings reinforce the clinical relevance of structured rehabilitation programs in improving motor outcomes and activity levels for stroke recovery.<br/><br/>Building on this, BCI-FEST therapy emerges as a promising approach for enhancing upper limb motor recovery and functional independence. BCI-FEST therapy demonstrated statistically significant improvements in upper-limb motor recovery, with Fugl-Meyer scores increasing to 38.7 (SD 16.5) compared to 14.29 (SD 4.3) in conventional therapy (p=0.012), and ARAT scores increasing to 26.7 (SD 18.3) compared to 4.8 (SD 6.3) (p&lt0.001) according to Ramirez-Nava et al. <a href="#ref22">2023</a>. Effect sizes were 0.99 for Fugl-Meyer and 0.84 for ARAT, indicating substantial gains. Additionally, functional independence (FIM) showed a mean gain of 1.24 (SD 12.5), and motor function (Fugl-Meyer) improved by 12.5 (SD 10.5) with p-values of 0.012 and 0.025, respectively, reflecting notable advancements in rehabilitation outcomes.<br/><br/>The observed structural and functional motor-network changes further underscore the potential of targeted interventions in facilitating motor recovery. Bigoni et al. (<a href="#ref23">2023</a>) found that the intervention demonstrated a 5-point increase in FM-UE scores (p &lt0.05). Structural and functional motor-network changes were observed, including increased fractional anisotropy in the cortico-spinal tract and enhanced brain activation during motor tasks, supporting the treatment's potential in facilitating motor recovery.<br/><br/>Expanding on these advancements, the NuroSleeve demonstrates its utility in improving functional performance and achieving patient-centered rehabilitation goals. Khantan et al. (<a href="#ref24">2023</a>) show that the NuroSleeve facilitates significant improvements in functional performance and satisfaction in activities of daily living, as evidenced by COPM scores. Participants reported increases of 2 points or more in performance and satisfaction ratings, surpassing the clinically meaningful improvement threshold. Notably, some participants achieved scores as high as 9 out of 10, with at least three out of five participants meeting or exceeding the threshold, indicating its effectiveness in addressing self-identified goals.<br/><br/>Finally, the application of FES-UPP highlights both its effectiveness in enhancing functional outcomes and the need for addressing practical challenges in its implementation. Smith et al. (<a href="#ref25">2019</a>) findings indicate that the application of FES-UPP enhances functional performance in individuals with stroke, as reflected by mean WMF-FAS scores of 2.6 (Rater A) and 2.2 (Rater B) with the intervention, compared to 1.5 and 1.3 without it, respectively, with statistically significant differences (p &lt0.05). Additionally, the intervention demonstrated high participant acceptability, with 93% expressing a willingness to recommend the system. Usability challenges were noted, with a total of 42 errors observed during setup, suggesting specific areas for optimization in the implementation process.<br/><br/>The findings outline various intervention strategies and their outcomes in upper limb rehabilitation post-stroke.

      Discussion, Findings: Spinal Cord Injury: Mobility and Clinical Management
    </h1>
<p>
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) plays a crucial role in enhancing mobility and clinical management for spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, marked by noteworthy advancements in adaptive stimulation strategies and biomechanical sensing technologies. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in motor control, muscle fatigue mitigation, and postural adjustments. Notably, trunk stabilization performance metrics indicate consistent responses under perturbation forces, with mean settling times ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 seconds and response times around 400 ms [<a href="#ref4">4</a>]. A closed-loop controller achieved an impressive mean reaction time of 125 ms to forward-directed perturbations [<a href="#ref5">5</a>], with quicker responses observed for larger perturbations. Furthermore, closed-loop stimulation protocols improved joint moments, reduced instability, and enhanced efficiency, as evidenced by increased total work and decreased stimulation costs [<a href="#ref6">6</a>]. Hybrid neuroprostheses have shown promise in reducing muscle fatigue and motor torque requirements [<a href="#ref7">7</a>], leading to improved control and reduced strain. Significant advancements in gait support were also noted with neuroprostheses, which increased foot dorsiflexion and plantarflexion [Philipp Müller et al. <a href="#ref8">2020</a>]. Additionally, FES applied during weight-bearing exercises has proven effective in enhancing biomechanical performance, resulting in increased supported body weight and improved postural stability [<a href="#ref9">9</a>].<br/><br/>In terms of aerobic fitness, significant improvements in VO2peak have been documented through FES interventions. Farkas et al. (<a href="#ref35">2021</a>) reported a notable 21-22% increase in VO2peak in their randomized controlled trial, while Johnston et al. (<a href="#ref37">2009</a>) found a 16.2% enhancement in their FES cycling group compared to passive cycling. However, the lack of new studies since the previous review limits the ability to further validate these findings, highlighting a critical gap in recent research on this outcome [<a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a>]. Mixed outcomes have been observed regarding stroke volume, with Tweedy et al. (<a href="#ref39">2017</a>) suggesting a reduction in exercising stroke volume, indicating potential limitations in cardiovascular improvements through FES. Contrastingly, Hasnan et al. (<a href="#ref19">2013</a>) and Brurok et al. (<a href="#ref18">2011</a>) provided evidence of stroke volume enhancement under specific training conditions, yet the absence of new studies further complicates the validation of these findings [<a href="#ref39">39</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>].<br/><br/>Significant improvements in Muscle Cross-Sectional Area (CSA) have been reported, with a majority of studies demonstrating positive outcomes, particularly in hypertrophy [<a href="#ref38">38</a>]. However, the absence of new data on Muscle CSA suggests a need for further exploration to confirm or expand upon these results, as previous studies laid a robust foundation for the efficacy of FES in enhancing muscle size [<a href="#ref38">38</a>, <a href="#ref40">40</a>, Gorgey et al. 1985]. Regarding lean mass, modest improvements were observed with FES interventions, particularly when combined with nutritional strategies or resistance training [<a href="#ref41">41</a>]. Despite significant gains in lean mass reported by Dolbow et al. (<a href="#ref41">2021</a>) and Griffin et al. (<a href="#ref42">2009</a>), the lack of new studies limits the ability to draw more comprehensive conclusions about the long-term efficacy of FES in neurorehabilitation [<a href="#ref42">42</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a>, <a href="#ref40">40</a>].<br/><br/>In terms of body composition, notable reductions in body fat percentage have been documented among patients with neurological injuries through FES applications. Farkas et al. (<a href="#ref35">2021</a>) reported a 5% decrease in body fat percentage, while Dolbow et al. (<a href="#ref41">2021</a>) highlighted greater reductions in an FES combined with nutrition group. Although the absence of new studies since the previous review limits further validation, the consistency of earlier findings underscores the potential of FES in improving body composition [<a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a>]. The management of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) has been positively influenced by FES, with recent evidence from Zoulias et al. (<a href="#ref9">2019</a>) supporting its effectiveness in improving BMD in SCI patients. These findings align with earlier studies demonstrating the potential of electrically induced muscular loading to prevent BMD decline post-SCI [<a href="#ref43">43</a>, <a href="#ref44">44</a>]. However, earlier skepticism regarding the efficacy of physical rehabilitation on bone metabolism remains a point of discussion [<a href="#ref45">45</a>]. The impact of FES on inflammatory markers has yielded mixed findings, with some studies indicating a lack of significant changes while others observed reductions in inflammatory biomarkers like IL-6 and TNF-alpha [<a href="#ref38">38</a>, <a href="#ref42">42</a>]. The absence of new studies in this area highlights the need for further investigation to clarify FES's role in modulating inflammatory responses.<br/><br/>Lastly, the improvements in muscle strength through FES interventions are noteworthy, with Rosley et al. (<a href="#ref46">2023</a>) demonstrating significant increases in muscle peak torque in the FES-LCE+PRT group compared to the FES-LCE group. Despite these promising results, the lack of new studies limits the ability to further validate or challenge these findings, emphasizing the need for continued research in this domain [<a href="#ref46">46</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a>, <a href="#ref48">48</a>].

      Discussion, Findings: Stroke: Upper Limb Rehabilitation
    </h1>
<p>
      The integration of functional electrical stimulation (FES) in upper limb rehabilitation for post-stroke patients has shown promising results in restoring motor function and enhancing functional independence. Notably, Fujimoto et al. (<a href="#ref21">2024</a>) reported a significant mean change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scores of 14.6 (p=0.009), alongside improvements in activity measures such as MAL-AOU and MAL-QOM, reinforcing the efficacy of task-oriented rehabilitation programs [<a href="#ref21">21</a>]. This finding aligns with the work of Ramirez-Nava et al. (<a href="#ref22">2023</a>), who demonstrated that BCI-FEST therapy markedly outperformed conventional therapy, with FMA scores increasing to 38.7 (p=0.012) and ARAT scores reaching 26.7 (p&lt0.001). These outcomes indicate substantial gains in motor recovery, corroborating earlier research that indicated similar enhancements in motor function [<a href="#ref49">49</a>, <a href="#ref49">49</a>].<br/><br/>Moreover, Bigoni et al. (<a href="#ref23">2023</a>) provided evidence of structural and functional changes in motor networks, including increased fractional anisotropy, which supports the notion of motor recovery facilitated by FES interventions [<a href="#ref23">23</a>]. Complementing these findings, Khantan et al. (<a href="#ref24">2023</a>) highlighted the effectiveness of the NuroSleeve in improving functional performance and satisfaction in daily activities, with COPM scores exceeding clinically meaningful thresholds, thus emphasizing the practical benefits of these interventions [<a href="#ref24">24</a>]. Furthermore, Smith et al. (<a href="#ref25">2019</a>) found that FES-UPP significantly enhances functional performance, demonstrating notable improvements in WMF-FAS scores and high participant acceptability, albeit with some usability challenges [<a href="#ref25">25</a>].<br/><br/>In addition to the FMA, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) has also been instrumental in evaluating upper limb function post-intervention. Recent studies indicate that the improvements in ARAT scores align with previous findings, showcasing the effectiveness of BCI and MeCFES interventions in enhancing upper limb function [<a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>]. Ramirez-Nava et al. (<a href="#ref22">2023</a>) specifically noted statistically significant enhancements in ARAT scores within the BCI-FEST group, further supporting the efficacy of BCI-based rehabilitation strategies [<a href="#ref22">22</a>]. The favorable outcomes observed, with ARAT improvements exceeding minimal clinically important differences, suggest a robust clinical benefit from these interventions [<a href="#ref21">21</a>].<br/><br/>However, it is worth noting that discrepancies in the magnitude of reported improvements may arise from variations in study designs, such as the differences between controlled clinical trials and case series methodologies. Nevertheless, the recent studies contribute significantly to the evidence base, employing advanced methodological approaches that enhance our understanding of FES's impact on upper limb rehabilitation following stroke or spinal cord injury. Overall, the collective findings underscore the potential of FES as a therapeutic modality, with substantial implications for neurorehabilitation practices.

      Discussion, Limitations: Spinal Cord Injury: Mobility and Clinical Management
    </h1>
<p>
      The exploration of functional electrical stimulation (FES) in neurorehabilitation has made significant strides in addressing previously identified limitations in clinical management for patients with spinal cord injuries and other neurological impairments. A primary limitation noted in earlier reviews was the impracticality of extensive data collection and tuning of functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) controllers for clinical settings. Recent studies have introduced innovative methodologies to streamline this process. For example, a study employed real-time feedback mechanisms utilizing accelerometers to adjust muscle pulse widths based on trunk tilt, achieving effective trunk stability with mean settling times of 0.5-2 seconds [<a href="#ref4">4</a>]. Another study introduced a Dynamic Control Allocation (DCA) method, significantly reducing the need for extensive individual tuning by achieving a 43.3% reduction in RMS values compared to traditional systems [<a href="#ref7">7</a>]. Furthermore, an automatic parameter identification system was developed, reducing setup time to an average of 139 seconds, thereby enhancing usability in clinical applications [<a href="#ref8">8</a>]. Despite these advancements, the small sample sizes across these studies limit the generalizability of the findings, necessitating further research with larger and more diverse populations to fully validate these methodologies for broader clinical application.<br/><br/>Another critical limitation was the restricted ability to assume various leaning postures or resist postural disturbances, which hampers manual function performance in individuals with spinal cord injuries. To address this, new interventions have been explored, such as the use of implanted electrodes and advanced control systems. One study employed an accelerometer to dynamically adjust muscle stimulation based on trunk tilt, achieving mean settling times of 0.5 to 2 seconds and response times around 400 ms under perturbations up to 45% body weight [<a href="#ref4">4</a>]. Additionally, a reactive stepping controller was utilized to detect body perturbations, producing reaction times comparable to able-bodied individuals and enhancing balance recovery [<a href="#ref5">5</a>]. While these studies demonstrate moderate progress in improving postural control and stability, their small sample sizes and lack of control groups limit the generalizability of the findings. Thus, further research with larger and more diverse populations is essential for a comprehensive solution.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the limitation of constant supramaximal stimulation in open-loop systems, which accelerates muscle fatigue and limits standing duration and functionality, has been addressed through various innovative approaches. One study implemented a closed-loop reactive stepping controller, dynamically modulating stimulation based on real-time body perturbations, resulting in faster reaction times and effective balance recovery (p &lt0.005) while minimizing muscle fatigue [<a href="#ref5">5</a>]. Another study utilized a Dynamic Control Allocation method to adjust the workload between FES and motor inputs based on muscle fatigue estimates, achieving a 43.3% reduction in RMS error for knee angle regulation [<a href="#ref7">7</a>]. Additionally, a standing system integrating FES with biomechanical feedback allowed participants to stand for 60 minutes while maintaining significant body weight support, indicating enhanced functionality [<a href="#ref9">9</a>]. However, the effectiveness of these approaches is moderated by small sample sizes and limited data diversity, which restrict generalizability. Therefore, further research with larger, more diverse populations is necessary to fully validate their effectiveness and achieve comprehensive solutions.<br/><br/>Addressing the significant technical challenges in replicating complex sensorimotor systems with artificial sensing and actuation, a study implemented a reactive stepping controller utilizing advanced accelerometer signal processing within a closed-loop neuroprosthetic system [<a href="#ref5">5</a>]. The study demonstrated significant improvements in response times compared to able-bodied subjects, highlighting the potential of real-time control software and specific electrode placements. However, the limited sample size and lack of diversity in the population restrict the generalizability of these findings. Thus, further research with a larger and more diverse cohort is necessary to fully address the complexities of sensorimotor replication in neuroprosthetic systems.<br/><br/>Lastly, the reliance on assistive devices for upper-body support, which compromises arm functionality and accelerates fatigue, was addressed through a standing system integrating FES, biomechanical feedback, and exergaming. This approach resulted in a notable reduction in arm support to just 7.59% of body weight [<a href="#ref9">9</a>]. Participants achieved a stable weight-bearing posture, with their legs supporting over 70% of their body weight, demonstrating enhanced arm functionality and reduced fatigue during a full 60-minute standing session. Despite the promising outcomes, the small sample size of only three participants limits the generalizability of the results. Consequently, further research with a larger and more diverse population is necessary to fully validate these findings and establish a comprehensive solution.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while substantial progress has been made in addressing the limitations identified in previous reviews, the generalizability of these findings remains constrained by small sample sizes and limited population diversity. Future research should focus on expanding these studies to larger and more varied cohorts to ensure the broad applicability and effectiveness of these innovative methodologies in clinical settings.

      Discussion, Limitations: Stroke: Upper Limb Rehabilitation
    </h1>
<p>
      In the realm of upper limb rehabilitation for stroke patients, significant advancements have been made in addressing previously identified limitations within the context of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and its application in neurorehabilitation. A notable limitation from prior reviews was the small sample sizes in reported randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which compromised the reliability of findings. A recent study [<a href="#ref50">50</a>] has taken a substantial step forward by incorporating a cohort of 40 participants, thereby enhancing statistical power and the robustness of its conclusions. This study utilized a parallel-group, double-blind design to minimize bias and employed comprehensive outcome measures, such as the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) at multiple time points. By focusing on a population reflective of low- and middle-income countries, this research not only addresses the sample size limitation but also opens avenues for future exploration into broader applications. However, while this increase in sample size is an improvement, it remains moderate in effectiveness, as the adequacy relative to the diversity and complexity of stroke rehabilitation is yet to be fully established. Further research with even larger cohorts is necessary to comprehensively resolve this issue.<br/><br/>Additionally, the lack of RCTs in previous studies restricted the ability to generalize findings. A new study [<a href="#ref22">22</a>] has effectively mitigated this limitation by implementing a well-structured RCT design that compares Brain-Computer Interface-FES Therapy (BCI-FEST) with conventional therapy. This study reports statistically significant improvements in upper-limb motor function, with p-values of 0.012 for the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and &lt0.001 for the Action Research Arm Test, alongside high effect sizes of 0.99 and 0.84, respectively. The robust sample size, adherence rates, and comprehensive outcome measures further strengthen its findings, providing a solid foundation for future research. Despite these advancements, ongoing exploration into diverse populations and long-term effects is necessary to fully address the complexities of stroke rehabilitation.<br/><br/>The absence of follow-up data in prior research was another significant limitation, impeding the assessment of long-term outcomes. A recent study [<a href="#ref23">23</a>] has made strides in this area by providing follow-up data that demonstrate sustained motor improvements, with a reported 5-point increase in the Fugl-Meyer assessment from T0 to T2. The study also shows maintained improvements in hand function and enhanced daily life activities. However, its single-participant design and limited follow-up duration raise concerns about the generalizability and robustness of the results, highlighting the need for further research with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods to comprehensively evaluate long-term rehabilitation outcomes.<br/><br/>Finally, the absence of validation for neuroplasticity outcomes in FES-based rehabilitation was a critical limitation highlighted in previous reviews. Addressing this, a new study [<a href="#ref23">23</a>] employs a multimodal approach combining clinical assessments, electrophysiological measures, and neuroimaging data. This approach demonstrates a notable 5-point improvement in Fugl-Meyer scores and enhanced fMRI activation in motor cortices, indicating promising neural reorganization. Nevertheless, the single-participant design and lack of direct measures for assessing changes in motor-network structure and function limit the study's effectiveness. Thus, while moderate progress has been made in validating neuroplasticity outcomes, further research with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive methodologies is essential to fully confirm the efficacy of FES-based rehabilitation in promoting neuroplasticity.
    </p>
<h1 id="chapter_8">
      Conclusions
    </h1>
<p>
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has emerged as a transformative intervention in neurorehabilitation, particularly for patients with spinal cord injuries and stroke. Evidence indicates that FES significantly enhances motor function, muscle strength, and functional independence, as demonstrated by improved Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Action Research Arm Test scores. Moreover, advancements in adaptive stimulation strategies and neuroprosthetics have led to notable gains in muscle performance and postural stability, underscoring FES's role in facilitating recovery. However, limitations such as small sample sizes, methodological constraints, and a lack of longitudinal data temper these findings. Future research should focus on larger, more diverse cohorts, the incorporation of control groups, and the development of standardized outcome measures to validate these interventions further. Additionally, addressing technological challenges and exploring fatigue management strategies will be crucial for optimizing FES applications in clinical settings. By overcoming these barriers, the potential of FES in improving the quality of life for individuals with neurological injuries can be fully realized.
